For these, You will be required to submit certain documents that may include, without limitation, KYC documents, tax and other registration certificates, financial information and such further information or documents, in a form and manner acceptable to PayU, as PayU may request from time to time.  </li>
                            <li style="padding-left: 10px;">The Welcome Letter, together with the Application Form and the Pricing Schedule captures the commercial arrangement of the Parties whilst the Special Terms and Conditions apply to the specific Payment Mechanisms opted for by the Merchant and the General Terms and Conditions apply to the entire contractual relationship between You and PayU. In case of any inconsistency between the Special Terms and Conditions as applicable to a specific Payment Mechanism on the one hand and the General Terms and Conditions on the other, the Special Terms and Conditions shall prevail over the General Terms and Conditions to the extent of such inconsistency and the rest of the General Terms and Conditions will remain binding in accordance with their respective terms. For the avoidance of doubt, at a given date, the expression Master Services Agreement shall mean the Master Services Agreement as amended from time to time including by way of any Service Addenda. </li>
